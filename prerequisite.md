# Prerequisite

This guide on ERC-4337 dives into technical details and examples involving Solidity smart contracts. Readers should have a basic understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity.

If you're a developer looking to follow along with the examples,  you should also be familiar with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), as most of the examples in this guide will use Foundry for testing and deployment.
