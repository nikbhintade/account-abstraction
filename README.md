# Getting Started

For a long time, I kept hearing about account abstraction but never really took the time to dive into it. That changed recently after I watched a lesson on account abstraction by Cyfrin, which sparked my curiosity. Since then, I've spent a lot of time exploring the topic, combing through all the available content. The problem is, most of the resources are scattered, and beyond a few basic examples, there's not much out there for beginners.

That’s why I decided to create this guide. It’s designed to answer most of your questions about ERC-4337, with plenty of examples for developers eager to experiment with it.

Thanks, and I hope this guide helps!
